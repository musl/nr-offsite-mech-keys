# Code friendly 60% keymap

I developped this keymap to make a better use of 60% ortho keyboards I use like the preonic of the iris. Instead of trying to mimic the Planck layout like the default preonic keymap, this keymap removes the raise and lower layers and offers a simpler hyper layer concept for a few missing sign keys and cursors / media keys.

The important part for coders is that most important signs needed to code are available at their usual position on a full keyboard, without complex layer gymnastic. Access to [] and {} are available on the hyper layer at their usual emplacement.

The right thumb is used for both backspace and hyper layer switching. On the hyper layer, in addition to some coding signs, you get the cursor keys arranged in cross, just under your right fingers, so you don't have to move your hand when navigating in code or command line. Other hand gets the home/end page up/down in a similar layout.

Because you sometime have to use your internal keyboard when you use a macbook, a karabiner configuration is also provided to get most of the features of this keyboard, including the hyper layer / backspace on right command key etc.

This keymap is also available for other keyboards:
- [ortho_5x12/rs](../../../../layouts/community/ortho_5x12/rs/keymap.c)
- [ErgoTravel/rs](../../../ergotravel/keymaps/rs/keymap.c)
