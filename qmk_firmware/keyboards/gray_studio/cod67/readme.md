To put in bootloader mode, hold the `Esc` key while plugging in the USB cable. 

The COD67 will show up as a drive. 

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make gray_studio/cod67:default:bin

See the [build environment setup](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_build_tools) and the [make instructions](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_make_guide) for more information. Brand new to QMK? Start with our [Complete Newbs Guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs).

Rename the resulting `.bin` file to `cod67.bin`.

Drag and drop `cod67.bin` to the drive, overwriting the previous `cod67.bin` stored on it. 

Press the `Esc` key again to reset the board. You are now ready to type!

## Notes
The backlight pin is attached to a non PWM pin `D4` so backlight is only on/off.
