# Winkeyless

[Winkeyless](https://www.winkeyless.kr) is a Korean keyboard company popular for creating the Boot Mapper Client (BMC) firmware. Most Winkeyless boards were low profile and constructed out of acrylic showcasing their RGB underglow capabilities. 

In late 2018, Winkeyless closed its doors due to the numerous unlicensed implementations of its hardware and software. 

This directory contains official Winkeyless boards that have had QMK ported to work with them.
