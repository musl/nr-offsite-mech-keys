# KBD67

A 65% keyboard sold in two variants. Rev1 was a typical keyboard that had to be soldered together, supporting multiple layouts.
Months later, a new version with hotswap was sold. **Firmware files from one, will not work on the other.** Please use the `.hex` appropriate for your board.

The rev1 PCB for the KBD67 is sold under the name "KBD65."
