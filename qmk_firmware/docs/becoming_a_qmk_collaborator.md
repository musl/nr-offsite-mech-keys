# Becoming a QMK Collaborator

A QMK collaborator is a keyboard maker or designer that is interested in helping QMK grow and fully support their keyboard(s), and encouraging their users and customers to submit features, ideas, and keymaps. We're always looking to add more keyboards and collaborators, but we ask that they fulfill these requirements:

* **Have a PCB available for sale.** Unfortunately there's just too much variation and complications with handwired keyboards.
* **Maintain your keyboard in QMK.** This may just require an initial setup to get your keyboard working, but it could also include accommodating changes made to QMK's core that might break or render any custom code redundant.
* **Approve and merge keymap pull requests for your keyboard.** We like to encourage users to contribute their keymaps for others to see and work from when creating their own.

If you feel you meet these requirements, shoot us an email at hello@qmk.fm with an introduction and some links to your keyboard!
