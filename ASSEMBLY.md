## Assembly

1. Locate the front plate with the top plate with rectangular
	 switch cut-outs and orient it with the long sides to the top.

2. Snap a switch into the center hole from the black side, with the pins
	 facing down and oriented towards the top.

3. Locate the pre-soldered PCB. Note the silver receptacles for each
	 switch.

4. Carefully align both pins with the silver receptacles on the PCB and
	 gently press the switch into the receptacles. Take care not to bend
	 the pins.

5. Mount the remaining switches in the same fashion as the first. Each
	 switch should click into place in the top plate as you press-fit both
	 pins into the receptacles.

6. Once you have all seven switches mounted, check the fit of the top
	 plate.

7. Affix adhesive rubber feet to the bottom plate.

8. Locate the brass screws, standoffs, and the bottom plate. From the
	 bottom, insert the black screw, and thread it into the brass insert.
	 Tighten with your fingers.

9. Once all four stand-offs are tightened, find the 3D printed
	 translucent middle layer and, with the inner lip on the top side and
	 the holes for the connectors over the edge with the insulating tape,
	 fit the holes over the inserts.

10. Locate the top plate and PCB assembly. Line up the top edge with the
		insulating tape on the bottom plate so that the pro-micro is
		directly above the insulating tape. Angle the top plate so that the
		USB connector and reset switch match their access holes. Fit the
		assembly together.

11. Thread four black screws into their inserts from the top. Tighten
		all 8 black screws with your screwdriver. This will slightly
		compress the 3D printed mid.
